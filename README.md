## Predicting the probability that the customer will pay insurance premium on time or not from the past payment records.
Your client is an Insurance company and they need your help in building a model to predict
whether the policyholder (customer) will pay next premium on time or not.

As you can imagine, if a large number of customers do not pay the premium on time, it might
disrupt the cash flow and smooth operation for the company. A customer may stop making
regular premium payments for a variety of reasons - some may forget, some may find it expensive
and not worth the value, some may not have money to pay the premium etc.
Building a model to predict whether a customer would make the premium payment can be
extremely helpful for the company because it can then accordingly plan its communication
strategy to reach out to those customers who are less likely to pay and convince them to
continue making timely payment.
Now, in order to predict whether the customer would pay the next premium or not, you have
information about past premium payment history for the policyholders along with their
demographics (age, monthly income, area type) and sourcing channel etc.
